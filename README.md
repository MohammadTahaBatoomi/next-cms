## 🧠 Inspiration

The visual design and layout structure of this project were inspired by the repository [`next-cms`](https://github.com/hossein-ghanimati/next-cms) by [Original Author or Team Name].

> **Important Note:**  
> I have not copied any code from the original project.  
> This project was built completely from scratch and customized for use in my personal portfolio.  
> The goal was to practice UI structure and modern frontend development using [Next.js / React / Tailwind CSS / MUI / etc.].

All design decisions, coding logic, and components were implemented independently.
